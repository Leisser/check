I was also using the official image (FROM postgres) and I was able to change the config by executing the following commands.

The first thing is to locate the PostgreSQL config file. This can be done by executing this command in your running database.

SHOW config_file;
I my case it returns /data/postgres/postgresql.conf.

The next step is to find out what is the hash of your running PostgreSQL docker container.

docker ps -a
This should return a list of all the running containers. In my case it looks like this.

...
0ba35e5427d9    postgres    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦" ....
...
Now you have to switch to the bash inside your container by executing:

docker exec -it 0ba35e5427d9 /bin/bash
Inside the container check if the config is at the correct path and display it.

cat /data/postgres/postgresql.conf
I wanted to change the max connections from 100 to 1000 and the shared buffer from 128MB to 3GB. With the sed command I can do a search and replace with the corresponding variables ins the config.

sed -i -e"s/^max_connections = 100.*$/max_connections = 1000/" /data/postgres/postgresql.conf
sed -i -e"s/^shared_buffers = 128MB.*$/shared_buffers = 3GB/" /data/postgres/postgresql.conf
